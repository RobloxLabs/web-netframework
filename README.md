# web-netframework
A fan-made version of the 2013 ROBLOX website in ASP.NET WebForms & MVC. This project started on March 23rd, 2021 and has been modified by a total of 6 people over its lifespan. Its commit history is currently a part of a private repository, and will therefore not be publicly-accessible.
The project and code structure present were intentionally designed to replicate ROBLOX's codebase layout based on once *publicly-accessible* stacktraces produced and displayed by their websites from the years 2010 to 2022. Any similarities in project structure, class names, or method names to any pre-existing codebases are likely due to the aforementioned.
